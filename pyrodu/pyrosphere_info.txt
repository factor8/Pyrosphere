Make happy face pattern!!

Clear Serial Buffer

Reconfigure and reconcile Autopilot / √ Random animation settings ... Almost √
Reconfigure Modeselektor / setMode so that mode changes also reconfigure basic settings as necessary ... Almost √
Test disparaging nodedurations.... seems to be working
Make sure our 'active' flag placement is good. What should 'inactive' disable? √

Set MAx and Min value duration and interval hard stops...

0 - Autopilot
	Autopilot implies random pattern.
	
	
1 - Master Pattern Controller
	Pattern Mode which implies non random pattern controlled by tablet. or just readDir next.
	Access to change Interval and Duration and navigate patterns logically
	Progresses incrementally through patterns?
	
2 - Valve Control
